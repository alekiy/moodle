<h1>Course key</h1>

<p>
  With this setting, you can manual set the course key for the current course. This overwrites
  the course key managed by the Moodle administrator. How ever, when no course key is available
  for this course, you can define it yourself and match keys between QUAMP and Moodle.
  If you wish to use the settings managed by the Moodle Administrator, let this field empty.
